##### 例子

> Some people believe famous people's support towards international aid organizations draws the attention to problems, while others think celebrities make the problems seem less important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.



It is quite common that many celebrities, like movie stars and famous athletes, participate in activities held by international aid organizations. Opinions are divided on how their support affects these activities. **I believe that famous people’s involvement in charitable events can definitely attract more attention and provide more help to the problems.** 



**On the one hand,** **there has been a concern that the importance of charitable activities may be weakened with the presence of many famous people.** This is because fans of the movie stars or the NBA legends may pay more attention to how their idols dress themselves or whether they are in the center of the stage. **What is worse,** tabloids lead readers to the gossips or scandals of the celebrities instead of how much they contribute to helping people in need. **This explains why many people worry that famous people may have a negative effect on the charitable activity they participate in.** 



**On the other hand,** **advocates of celebrities’ support towards worldwide pressing issues  believe that they have such significant influence on millions of people following their accounts on social media, such as Twitter or Facebook.** When these famous people deliver a speech in a fundraising gala or make a donation to an organization towards assisting needy people in third world countries, **their followers may contribute their own effort to combating the same problems.** **For example,** in 2015, hundreds of sports stars and Nobel Prize winners who took part in a series of activities named the Ice Bucket Challenge successfully promoted awareness of the disease ALS and encouraged donations to research.



**Personally,** my view is that while the attention of the public may be drawn from the event itself to the stars they are interested in, **this usually lasts for a short period of time.**  Support from these famous people, **in the long term,** will play a significant role in arousing people's awareness towards the issues that need to be addressed. 



> Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.  Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion. 



The argument over whether learning at home or at school is better for children has not been settled yet. Whereas home education offers better protection with individual learning and opportunities for families to bond, schools have a superior range of material and human resources. **Ultimately, I think the school experience is best for children.** 



**There are several advantages for children who learn at home.**  **Firstly,** they can spend more time with their parents and siblings. Many social problems are associated with families not spending enough quality time together. Teaching children at home also provides them with an individualised learning environment. **Instruction is custom designed** and moves at the child’s own pace and in accordance with his or her individual learning style. **Finally, home schooling protects children from bullies and others who might be a bad influence**. 

 (三个点，各有解释，但还是建议不写这么多。)



**On the other hand,** the school environment also offers advantages for children. Schools encourage children to socialise with their peers and learn how to cope with gossip, bullying and peer pressure. **In addition,** children will receive better tuition across a range of disciplines, as schools have teachers who are trained in special subjects. **What is more,** schools provide better access to physical resources such as sports equipment, musical instruments and library books.  

(三个点，各有解释，但还是建议不写这么多。)



I believe that children are better off in a school environment. **Although** family time and individual learning are important, the range of expertise and resources that schools offer cannot be matched in the home. School environments may present difficult social situations, **but** so too does the real world and children must learn to navigate these on their own. 



#### 取决于

内容需与核心段扩展内容相关

##### 举例

> Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.



It is considered by some that being a university graduate is the key to securing a good job, while there are others who think that it is better to have experience and soft skills. **In my opinion, I believe that having university education is essential for academic jobs while soft skills and experience are more useful in business.**

**On the one hand,** many think it is easier for most people to find a good job if they are university graduates with a good degree. In other words, having tertiary education puts people one step ahead of others who do not and this can be the deciding factor in getting a good job. The competition to get in to universities and the increasing number of graduates show just how significant this level of education is for people's future work opportunities.

**On the other hand,** having work experience and soft skills, such as leadership skills and other interpersonal skills, can also throw the balance in favour of the applicant, according to some. For many positions there are an overwhelming number of applicants and, therefore, it is often thought that having relevant experience in that line of work or having acquired useful soft skills that can be valuable to a company, can put one ahead of the game when applying for a position.



Finally, in my opinion, whether needing high level education or skills and experience, **depends on the position being applied for.** Take for example law, medicine or teaching, it is impossible to be considered for a position without the required educational background. In contrast, in business, it would be more important for a candidate to have soft skills and experience in that line of business so they can step into a position without further training and be of immediate benefit to the company.

 – 必须要详细解释的个人观点段

**In conclusion,** getting a good job requires a relevant background either in experience or education depending on the type of work and field. People should make sure they attain the necessary skills or degrees before applying for a job in order to be sure of success. – 重复前面的个人观点

##### 强调共性的话术

1. I believe that rules and freedom **play equally** important roles, so they should **co-exist** in the growth of every child. 
2. I believe that the **joint effort** of the government and individuals is the key to eradicating environmental problems. 
3. I believe that **a combination of** skyscrapers and low-rise buildings is an ideal strategy of city planning. 
4. I believe that **both** punishments **and** other measures should be used together to make roads safer. 

##### 举例

> Some believe cities should build more high-rise buildings, while others say it is better for people’s life to restrict the height of buildings. Discuss both views and give your opinion.



Most modern cities are faced with the dilemma of using their limited land resources to build high-rise or low-rise buildings. **I believe that a combination of both is an ideal strategy for city planning.** 



**Increasing the number of high-rise buildings is beneficial to the development of cities in terms of economic growth and environmental improvements.** With regard to the former, as skyscrapers can significantly increase the space available for business and residence, a larger number of companies and employees can be well accommodated in cities, such as London or New York, which may contribute to more business activities and better economy. **The other benefit of** an increasing number of tall buildings is that more open spaces can be saved for various public facilities, such as parks, squares, and sports facilities. All of these contribute to improvements in citizens' living environment.  



**On the other hand,** people in support of the government posing a limit on the height of buildings believe that living in such an environment has obvious advantages to their day-to-day life. **Firstly,** if the community mainly consists of three or four-storey residential buildings, each household can enjoy more sunshine and better ventilation which contribute to lifting peoples' spirit and improving their health. **In addition,** residents of low-rise buildings, which usually are not equipped with lifts, are forced to climb stairs on a daily basis. As a result, a healthier lifestyle can be promoted and people are also more likely to meet their neighbours.



**In my opinion,** a well-planned city should grow vertically with more tall buildings in central business districts, while providing citizens with more comfortable communities by limiting the height of their houses. In short, only by **combining tall and short buildings** can a city be developed in the best way. 



> Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. 



People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. **In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.** 



On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. **There are various types of driving penalty,** **such as** small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. **As a result,** we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully. 



**On the other hand,** (many people believe that) safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. **Firstly,** it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. **Secondly,** more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. **Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents** by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car. 



自己写一下这个结尾段

In my opinion, strict punishments will wipe off the thoughts of risking driving from the drivers' mind, while   safer roads is able to lower the possibility of accidents caused by bad driving conditions. In short, the joint effort of strict punishments for the violation and increasing attention to the insurance of road safety is the key to a safer traffic.

> In my view, implementing stringent penalties can effectively deter drivers from engaging in risky behavior, eradicating the inclination for reckless driving. Simultaneously, prioritizing the improvement of road safety measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents stemming from adverse driving conditions. To sum up, the collaborative approach of enforcing strict penalties for violations and heightened focus on enhancing road safety measures is pivotal to ensuring safer traffic conditions.
