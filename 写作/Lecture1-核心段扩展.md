# Lecture1: 核心段扩展

### Topic sentence要求

- 与题目紧密相关，不能随心所欲，一般来自原题或者个人观点。

- 在往下细化的时候， TS 必须是一个自己有把握能扩展的方向，否则写不动；

- 大部分情况下 Topic sentence 会是一个明确的结果或者明确的建议，偶尔可以用一个事实或者趋势来作为 TS ，但主要用在分析原因来的题目中。

### 扩展公式1

#### 分析题目相关的**一个**好处/坏处

1. TS, 开门见山地给出观点

2. because原因解释，尽量从物的角度出发

3. for instance, 详细举例

4. In contrast, / if..., 对比反向假设

5. Therefore，改写重复第一句

#### 举例
##### TS + 原因解释 + 对比 -- 早上学对孩子的好处

**Another advantage of going to school at an early age is that children develop faster socially.** ( 针对前面 socially 的解释，省略了 This is because)They make friends and learn how to get on with other children of a similar age.( 没有举例，但是用上学和在家待着作为对比 )**This is often not possible at home** because they are the only child, or because their brothers or sisters are older or younger.

##### TS + 原因解释 + 举例解释 --- 互联网的使用导致隐私威胁

**On the other hand, using the internet does have a potential cost with regard to loss of privacy.** (**This is**
**because**) everything that internet users do is recorded by companies **such as Google and Facebook**, and there is not much that the typical user can do to prevent it. **For example,** internet users should bear in mind that all of their emails and searches are saved, and that Google might know more about their activities than their families do. **As far as Facebook is concerned,** its users seem happy to reveal the identities of their friends and families, as well as their daily activities, even though this private information is stored definitely. **If it fell into the wrong hands**, it could represent a real threat to people's freedom, security, and money.

##### TS + 原因解释 + 举例解释 + 另一个原因 -- 鼓励学生给老师评分

**Encouraging students to criticize or grade their teachers contributes to improving teaching quality.**
This is partly because complaints from the former help the latter to become aware of the defects in their teaching methods. For example, if a large proportion of students complain about the difficulty of math classes, the teacher will improve the situation by making more explanation or slowing down the pace of learning. Apart from that, as important decisions including merit reviews, pay raises, and promotions are based in part on these evaluations, teachers must treat feedback carefully and do everything possible to make improvements in their teaching, such as spending more time correcting homework. 

#### 自己练习

不可否认不同年纪的人有不同的购物习惯。（这是因为）随着年纪增长，人们的需求和兴趣在不断变化。比如说，小孩子把零花钱全花在零食和玩具上，而年轻人则开始追逐时尚，购买潮流的鞋子和衣服。中年人的钱主要被用来改善生活质量比如更大的房子和更好的汽车，而老年人则只愿意花钱在健康相关的产品上。



Undeniably, people of different ages exhibit distinct shopping habits, as their needs and interests evolve with age. For instance, children tend to spend their pocket money on snacks and toys, while young adults shift their focus towards chasing trends, purchasing fashionable shoes and clothing. Middle-aged individuals often allocate their finances to enhance their quality of life, such as investing in larger homes and better cars. On the other hand, elderly individuals are inclined to allocate their funds primarily to health-related products.



在家工作效率低 – 因为有分心和干扰 – 比如说宠物或者小孩子



The efficiency of remote work is a topic of considerable concern in today's society. While some argue that working from home can enhance productivity, I contend that it may pose challenges leading to decreased efficiency. Firstly, remote work is susceptible to various distractions such as household chores, television, or social media. These factors can hinder employees from maintaining focus, thereby reducing overall work efficiency. Secondly, working from home may result in a lack of face-to-face communication with colleagues. Direct communication facilitates quicker problem resolution and promotes team collaboration. In a virtual environment, communication becomes more complex, potentially causing disruptions in information flow and subsequently affecting work efficiency. Therefore, despite providing a more flexible work environment for some individuals, the potential efficiency issues associated with remote work should not be overlooked. To maximize productivity, effective management measures need to be implemented when working from home, ensuring the ability to address various potential distractions and maintaining robust communication channels.



### 扩展公式2

#### 分析题目相关的**多个**好处/坏处

1. TS, 给出必须使用信号词引出大方向 some/several/numerous/two
2. first, 给出第一个好处/坏处 -> because, 原因解释，举例
3. second, 给出第二个好处/坏处 -> because, 原因解释，举例

有的时候在一个核心段需要给出两个及以上的分论点，这时候 TS 给人的感觉是至少包括两个分论点。
**这种情况一般出现在 Discuss 或者 outweigh 这类题型中**

#### 举例

##### 支持校服的理由

**People in favor of students wearing school uniforms believe that it has a number of benefits.** **Firstly**, requiring students to wear uniforms helps reduce peer pressure. When everyone in the class is dressed in the same way, they are not likely to talk about the price and taste of clothes. As a result, no one would feel a sense of superiority or prejudiced.  **In addition,**  the rule of wearing school uniforms keeps the campus safe. This is because those who are not members of the school can be easily recognized and kept outside. There are consequently fewer possibilities of some incidents, such as theft or gang bullying on campus.

##### 联系外星人的好处

**On the one hand, from the perspective of some optimists, there may be great benefits to contacting alien life forms.** **Firstly,** It is likely that our neighbors in space would lend us their far more advanced technologies to solve a series of problems on the Earth. For example, environmental pollution could be eradicated and life-threatening diseases could be cured if we could be technologically improved by our alien friends. **What is more,** with their assistance, human beings may be able to make a significant step forward to live on other planets. This means that we would no longer be afraid of facing any catastrophe that might destroy our home planet.

##### 和他人一起生活的好处

**On the one hand, there are two reasons why some people say we are more dependent on each other now.**  **Firstly,** the cost of living has increased so dramatically that life is more complex and difficult. Young adults, for example, have to rely on their parents for financial help when renting a flat or buying a house. Housing prices are higher than ever, and if relying on themselves it would be impossible for many young people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. **Secondly,** people want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.



##### 举办奥运会的好处（TS 有预告的效果)

**Holding the Olympic Games allows the host country to reap benefits in terms of economic growth and public health.** **With regard to the former,** millions of people are attracted to the host county to watch world-class sports games and to experience the local culture, **both of which bring** in billions of dollars in cash and create a large number of job opportunities. The other contribution made by hosting this international event is that an interest in sports will be developed in the public as the government builds more sports facilities and introduces knowledge of various sports. **As a result,** they would become more physically active and the level of health in the general population could be improved.

住在楼房高层的人们享受一些好处。首先，他们有更好的视野景观。比如说，他们可以看到城市的全貌以及城市外面的自然风景。其次，高层住户享受更好的生活环境，因为家里会有更好的光线和通风，这对保持房间卫生有很大帮助。



Residing in high-rise buildings offers several advantages. Firstly, occupants benefit from an enhanced panoramic view, allowing them to appreciate the overall cityscape and the natural scenery beyond the urban environment. Secondly, residents in high-rise structures enjoy a superior living environment with improved natural light and ventilation in their homes. This contributes significantly to maintaining cleanliness and hygiene within living spaces.



在家工作让人们可以灵活安排时间和享受舒适的环境。 With regard to the former, 在家工作的人可以按照自己的情况来决定工作和休息。比如说，......... The other benefit is that 人们可以很舒服地在家工作。比如说，没有必要穿正装或者 high heels ，可以选择最舒服的衣服。



Working from home allows individuals to flexibly manage their time and enjoy a comfortable environment. Regarding the former, those working remotely can decide when to work and when to take breaks based on their own circumstances. For instance, parents may find it convenient to schedule work around their children's needs, creating a more adaptable and harmonious routine.

The other benefit is that people can work comfortably from home. For example, there is no need to wear formal attire or high heels; individuals can opt for the most comfortable clothing.
