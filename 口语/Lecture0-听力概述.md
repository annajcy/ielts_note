### 举例

> Do you like trees?

Do I like trees? **Um, that's a ... that’s a ... Well, I’m looking for a word to describe your question, cuz I feel that it’s not like most of the NORMAL questions we would get in everyday conversation.** I mean, I like reading, I like traveling, I like playing soccer ... but trees? I don't have any feelings for them.



> What kind of clothes do you never wear?

**What kind of clothes do I never wear??? Um ... haha, this is an interesting question. Well, I love leisure wear, like sweatshirts and pants, hoodies and so on. But I also dress formally at times if I have to go somewhere formal. Sorry, I can’t think of anything.** Of course, I’m a man, I’ve never worn a dress or skirt.



> What kind of clothes do you never wear?

What kind of clothes do I never wear??? Um ... haha, this is an interesting question. Well, I love leisure wear, **like ... like ... the kind of coat that I wore yesterday. Of course, you can’t see it now, but I wore it to the gym and I felt very comfortable in it while working out. But this is what I LIKE.** Um, sorry, I can’t think of anything that I never wear right now.



> Do you prefer sending or receiving messages?

Honestly, I like neither of them. I just don’t like the
idea of messages. **Writing a message takes time, and**
**when it comes to receiving one, I might not**
**completely understand what that text really means.**
So I actually prefer making phone calls, which is a
lot more direct.



> What kinds of interesting things have you done
> with science?

**Can I just say I don’t like science at all? I’ve never**
**liked it, I’ve never found it easy to learn, so I don’t**
**suppose I’ve done anything interesting with science.** Perhaps when I was in school, some of the experiments we did were interesting to my classmates, but not to me.
